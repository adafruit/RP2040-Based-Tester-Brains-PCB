### Description

This board is what we use internally at Adafruit to program and test boards with microcontrollers on them. An [RP2040 Pico](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5525) (or perhaps PicoW?) is used to run the test software. [Use a 16x2 LCD (ideally RGB backlight)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/398)( for display output with color feedback such as green for pass, red for fail. Firmware files can be stored on MicroSD card which is slotted in. Connect the right hand side to the device-under-test jig which can be different for each product. [USB Host testing is done with bitbang PIO support in TinyUSB!](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TinyUSB_Arduino) The RP2040 can also perform ESP32 programming, RP2040-via-USB, AVR ICSP/UPDI, or SWD DAP. [See the TestBed library for some examples.](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TestBed)
